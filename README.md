## TV SCRIPT GENERATION

Third project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program

### NOTES:

1. I tried to recheck my answers and refactor the code at the time that the workspace is having difficulty to autosave the notebook. Some of my changes are unsaved so if there are inconsistencies, redundancies or grammatical errors that would affect the score of my submission, please point it out to me judiciously.
2. This is MY OWN WORK with basis from the course's notebooks, PyTorch forums, Slack group recommendations and Udacity's knowledge panel answers. If you think that I did something wrong in terms of your rules to plagiarism or anything that is within the honor code rules, kindly let me know.
